# Sims 4 Seven Seas
After anadius has quit the sims 4 sailing community and taken down all his work i scrambled together everything i could find from him. Use this to continue to play and sail Sims 4.

Note: All of this is anadius's work backed-up. I have simply stored his work here since his website is down. It has every major dlc and every kit/pack i could find a mirror of that was still avaliable and not taken down.

# Instructions
1. Download the EA DLC Unlocker.
2. If your on Windows run setup.bat, If your on Linux(superior) run setup_linux.sh.
3. Install the DLC unlocker and install the Game Config (from the file you run)
4. Download the DLCs you want.
5. On Steam go to Setting > Browse Local Files of your Sims 4 game.
6. Extract the DLC zip file into the following folder that has opened. If it asks, replace/merge the files. If it extracts as "Sims4_DLC_EP03_City_Living" etc, simply drag the folders inside out into the Sims 4 folder.
7. Run your game, Enjoy it while it lasts!

Download DLCs from here: https://gofile.io/d/U62XmA

Note: If it says that your unable to download the files it means ive reached my download size limit for the month since im a free user. Wait until next month or seek alternatives. Let me know if the files go down entirely and ill reupload them.

# Alternative DLC Downloads
Since these DLCs are not originaly provided by Anadius i cannot prove how safe or how well they all work though they have worked for me. I also cannot maintain the downloads here.

# Future of DLC Unlocker

I have dabbled with his code a bit in my spare time and i think im starting to understand it, though i dont fully understand how DLCs are defined yet so ill do a bit of experimenting. If things go well i might be able to continue his work for him in terms of making new DLCs work. If anyone is experienced with Windows Batch Script and would like to help this project, feel free to message me as in the future if anything happens directly to the unlocker i would only be able to continue working on the Linux release.

In terms of making a brand new Sims 4 Updater, I do not have access to the source code of Sims 4 Updater, and reverse engineering it is extremely difficult since its compiled with PyInstaller. I would need to learn how to make a brand new program to do this from scratch which i currently dont have the skills or recources to do.
